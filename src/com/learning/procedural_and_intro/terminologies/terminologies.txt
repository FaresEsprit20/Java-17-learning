JDK (Java Development Kit) : JDK includes JRE and JVm Plus all tools which are necessary for development of Java programs.
 The debugger exists in JDK. We don't need the debugger in JRE.


JRE (Java Runtime Environment) : JRE includes Jvm itself plus Java binaries and classes which are needed to execute programs.


JVM (Java Virtual Machine) : Java virtual Machine is responsible for converting Byte code to Machine specific language.
It is written in c++.
You compile your using the Java compiler to byte code and then the Jvm executes that Byte code.
