OOP definition: is a programming paradigm based on object.
It is a software design approach in which concept of object occupies the first place.

Object: object is always an instance of a class, it usually has properties and methods.

Class: is a template for the object.

Advantages of oop: Modularity, Scalability, Lower cost of development, Security and Reliability.

OOP principles :

1/Inheritance: Allows you to extend classes and inherit their properties and methods and reuse them without the need to recreate them or reinvent the wheel.

2/Polymorphism: We can have one interface and multiple implementations. (For example for engine of car electric or gasoline) It allows us
to write methods in many forms using overriding @override and overloading(Overload the methods signature).

3/Abstraction: Allows us to not duplicate the code , regroup the common properties and features in one class

4/Encapsulation: Keeps the data safe from external interference using the modifiers : private , default, protected, public
